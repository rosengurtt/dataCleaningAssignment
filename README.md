# Data Cleaning Course assignment

R script to clean data for the assignment of the Data Cleaning course of Cursera

The script file "run_analysis.R" containts 2 functions, to produce the 2 cleaned datasets requested in the assignment.

If you were to run the functions manually, you woul run them like this.

**dataset1 <- GetCleanData(pathToFolder)**

**dataset2 <- GetAveragedCleanedData(pathToFolder)**

where pathToFolder is the path to the folder where the raw data was extracted.

The script at the end executes the second function automatically, assuming the data files are in the current directory, as it is indicated in the assignment submission instructions
